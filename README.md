# IBDG
Algorithm for CC and PF calculation for Test Feeder systems with high presence of IBDG

Algorithm produced by Luiz G. R. Tonini and Renato S. F. Ferraz in order to analyze the behavior of an electrical system with high penetration of distributed generation based on frequency inverters.
The program calculates the power flow and short circuit considering the data present in the IEEE test feeders and the IBDG operating modes defined by the regulatory agencies.
